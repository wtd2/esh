## Acknowledgements
* We would like to thank for the guidance from [Prof. Yinqian Zhang](http://yinqian.org) and all the TAs.
* We would also like to thank for the some selected projects ([minishell](https://git.42l.fr/Fabien/minishell), [21sh](https://git.42l.fr/Fabien/21sh) and [42sh](https://github.com/ptruffault/42sh)) from School 42, as these projects show us a fundamental architecture to build a shell system.
